  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Social Learning is a website created for those who want to understand how to use social media apps inside a learning environment be it college or even school. Our goal is to help ensure you how the apps work and what features you could use to connect with those in your class. We set this website up for those who were curious on how to implement social media into their teaching environment and to be well educated to choose which social media app they want to use.</p>

    <h2>How we came to be</h2>
    <p>We, the students of CDM in TU Dublin Blanchardstown Campus have designed this website as a project that would help teachers and students alike understand the different uses of social media apps that could be used in a learning environment. We as a class set about gathering information regarding social media and how certain apps could be applied in the learning environment. We all helped eachother to bring you all the information you can find on Social Learning.</p>
