    <h2>Slack</h2>
    <div class="intro"><p>Slack is a huge social site that was designed specifically for the use of teachers and students and is widely used in colleges and even in some other schools. It can even be downloaded as a mobile app, which makes Slack even better. Slack is where the teacher sets up multiple channels in which the students could interact in. You can also privately any individual thatâ€™s invited into the slack channel.</p>

  <h3>Cautions</h3>
  <p>When it comes to social media in general, some basic things should be known when setting up an account and actually using them: Never share your password to anyone, even if your account is private, it could still reach a wider audience and think about what you post. In 'channels' they can sometimes become more of an immature group chat than a professional outlet where groups can share files, images, videos etc. It can also become a place for bullying but there isnt a lot of it documented which is a positive.</p>

<div class="app-uses">
  <h4>Educational Uses:</h4>
    <ul class="use-list">
      <li>Since the app was made specifically for students and teacher, all features are made for them and therefore it is easy to understand.</li>
      <li>Multiple channels could be set up for different topics by the teacher which the students could choose to join.</li>
      <li>You are also able to privately message students in the channel or even the teacher.</li>
    </ul>
