    <h2>Snapchat</h2>
    <div class="intro"><p>Snapchat is one of the biggest and most widely used social media apps in the world and is open and easy to use for all age ranges. Due to this, Snapchat would be perfect for educational use. In the app, you send pictures called ‘Snaps’ to friends which usually also features texts in the pictures. You can also send video and even post them to your ‘Story’ which shows you pictures or videos to all your friends. It is also easy to sign up for and the interface is simple for your average user.</p>

  <h3>Cautions</h3>
  <p>When it comes to social media in general, some basic things should be known when setting up an account and actually using them: Never share your password to anyone, even if your account is private, it could still reach a wider audience and think about what you post. On Snapchat, only the people you add can view your story. You can also post public stories which can be dangerous as anyone in the world could view them. Be careful who you add as they could send you snaps. If you wanna be extra careful, you can post private stories for close friends. </p>
