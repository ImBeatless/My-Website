  <h3>Cautions</h3>
  <p>When it comes to social media in general, some basic things should be known when setting up an account and actually using them: Never share your password to anyone, even if your account is private, it could still reach a wider audience and think about what you post. One of the easiest ways to stay protected on Instagram is to make your account private so the only people that could view your posts is when you accept their follow request. However, people could still see your profile picture and bio regardless. If someone is harrassing you, it is pretty simple to blok them and report them to Instagram. </p>
