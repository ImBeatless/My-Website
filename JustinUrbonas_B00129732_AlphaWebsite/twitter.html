  <h3>Cautions</h3>
  <p>When it comes to social media in general, some basic things should be known when setting up an account and actually using them: Never share your password to anyone, even if your account is private, it could still reach a wider audience and think about what you post. On twitter, you can protect your tweets which only allows the people you follow to view your tweets. Although, people can still access your account and see your profile picture and see your bio. You can also block users which doesnt allow them to see anything on your account except for your profile picture. </p>
